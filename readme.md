# Text editor written in c

It's a very small text editor. It can only *edit* text, it can't create new files. It most likely has bugs in it too! Wouldn't recommend using it. Did this because i was bored and wanted to try using NVim to write something and also to see how hard it would be to write a text editor in C.

The code most likely isn't very good my excuse is I dont write C ever. It works though. Also using arrays to store lines might've not been the best idea.
